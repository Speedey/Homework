        <h1><font size='7'>Projects and algorythms</font></h1>
        <h3><font size='5'>Contents Of this Page</font></h3>
        <p>This Page will containe Almost(hopefully) All off the previous algorythms and contents of the classes until these Holidays. There will be no particular order to what Algorythm comes after what.</p>
        <h3>Algorythms</h3>
        <p>As of kow, we have seen, learned, and experimented with alot of different sorts of Algorythms. The ones that Sort a list, The ones that search an element in a List and there have always been two possibilities, a simple short algorythme, with a high complexity, or a more complex algorythme, with the lowest kind of complexity; log(N)</p>
        <h4>Searching Algorythmes</h4>
        <p>The first one consisted in/still consists in cheking every single element in the list, no matter on the size of the list, and looks if it is the element we are looking for. The complexity was exponentiel, it grew with the size of the list. And thats why there is the Second option. This algorythm takes the list, and modifies it to its needs. For example, <a Title='Its a joke, Haha'>if its hungry it will consume part of the list.</a> It modifys the list so, it calculates the middle, checks if the element we are looking for is either bigger or smaller than the middle and voila; cuts of the beginning or the end off, since we dont need it. That process is repeated until we have found our element.</p>
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        <h4>Sorting algorytmes</h4>
        <p>There are <em>again</em>, 2 possibilities, tho this time, they are not as different. <a title='its f@#$ing horrible'>Sure one of them is not easy.</a> But they do have a similar complexity. So the first one is relativly simple, compares each item in the list with each other, so if you have a big list, you might have a big wait. then it just puts them in the right order, the reason why it is so slow, is because it can only compare 2 items at a time, therefor only order one item in the correct position. Here comes the 2nd Algorythm, this one thinks outside the box. It replaces the index of the elements, for say, it takes the big elements, such as high value numbers, and pushes it threw the list.(or takes the small element at the end and pushes it in the other direction.)</p>

        <h4><a title='it was in the example and i like good grades'>Binary and Systems</a></h4>
        <p>Binary, oh boy, The language of the PC, 0 and 1, the base of most eclectronics. It truly isnt that hard, to be honest, its like html: looks scary but it aint. Binary, or Base 2(0 and 1) can only be written with 0 and 1, every number has a binary counterpart, which you count by the 0 and 1, for example: 0 (base10)= 0(base2), 1(base10)= 1(base2) - simple right? well yes, but actually no, you can line up these 0 and 1 to make bigger numbers, 15 = 1111. With each new "number slot" representing a power of 2.</p>
        <p>PC's usually run with a OS, be it windows, linux, or mac os. They all have there advatages and disadvatages, but these OS's will either be a 32 or 64 bit system, which defines the amount of bits (binary digits) they can work with. Lets keep it simple and stay on a max of 8 Bits. In case you are over 8 bits, there will be an occurence called overflow, that means that all the bits longer than the 8th will be cut off. #Binary numbers are read from right to left, if there is overflow = [(110)10010011], the ones in the parentheses will be cut off. How does one represent positive and negative numbers? well the first(left to right) digit is usually the one wich defines if a number is positive(1) or negative(o)</p>

        <h4><a title='instead of learning for the oral Blanc :('>A small side project over the holidays</a></h4>
        <p>This project came to me on a night of solitude and confinement in my room, borred I thought, well Narcos is a good TV series, why cant i run a Drug buisness?? Right. Its illegal. But why is there no Video game where you cann do that, and i looked everywhere, but nothing suited my fit. So why not make it myself? and thats what i did - stupid idea - i still did it.</p>
        <p>And why not put it here on the page, if i only knew how. Still i can give a copy --- WORK IN PROGRESS--- with code if there is the time and will to try it out.</p>
