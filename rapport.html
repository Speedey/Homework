        <h2>IT ISNT A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</h2>
        <h3>What is html and css</h3>
        <p>Html is <em>NOT</em> a programming panguage, it's a writing tool to represent text, numbers and images on a webpage. There are a few commands, Tools and attributes, wich need to be respected in order to make the representation as accurate as the developper whishes for it to be. CSS on the other hand is merely the make up for html, making everything look beautiful and shiny. It also has its own commands, tools and attributes, wich also need to be respected.</p>
        <p>In HTML and there are different Tags, which each represent  a form of text, there a Titles, paragraphs, lists, headers etc... Like a word document, but here there is no button to click on, here you have to put the Tags around what you want it to be. You can embed Tags, but they have to be closed of in the right order, else the Browser wont really understand what you are giving him. There are all sorts of Tags, some modify the text, some create a link to another page, this entire project is based on these basic HTML elements. CSS is an extra to HTML, as said before, the Make up. In CSS you define the color, behaviour, position, font and style of different tags. It really comes down to the interactive capabilities of Java Script which make an Webpage really interesting. <em>But thats off limits</em>.</p>
        <p>What i have learned from This for now is, that HTML and CSS can be relativ simple, <a title='another joke for you, its probably not even that funny'>and that thanking the smart minds behind the smart writer is essential at every evening and morrning meal</a>.</p>
