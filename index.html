        <h3>My Professional carrier</h3>
        <p>As off know i habe archieved nothing other than a mediocer final exam, which in this world means: " I am not completely stupid, just enough to not do the rest of my scolarity", so it basically is worthless. Otherwise i have had a small role in a French Movie. The Movie was called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTULdAA84Dw" title="Trailer" target='_blank'> "Les Particules"</a> where i played a small role, the little brother. In fact i didnt have to play since my sister <em>WAS</em>my older sister. I do not yet know what will become of me later, probably university and a bachelor in psychology and then a Master in Criminology, that is the plan for now. If i dont get ubducced by aliens</p>

        <h3><Font size='4'>A little bit about myself</Font></h3>
        <p>As you might have figured, but probably not, i am the one and only knight wich protects the Realm of riveria, a mythical place in the imagination of a person, we will not state who. Its 2020, what did you expect?? This knight travells far and beyond and spends most of his time indors infront of a screen and a program he is willing to understand but not to master. He waits forever to work, if he does, and passes his time with nothiong, he just waits it out. But at times, he gets motivated and works and gets stuff done, when those times are have not yet been determined by the gods of this works. He is a fan if you couldnt tell by this short introduction, a fan of video games, so obviously of movies, cinema and TV. But with a very specific taste, to be Honest, most TV series are %#*@ anyway. </p>
